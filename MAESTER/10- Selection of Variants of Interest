#### To identify variants specific to the myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, the variant has to meet the following criteria: 
(a) meet the minimum VAF requirement for TAMs for the coverages in TAMs and Myeloid_PBMC categories. 
(b) VAF=0 in Myeloid PBMC category. 
(c)  VAF > minimum required for TAMs.

##### To identify variants specific to the myeloid cells in PBMC, the variant has to meet the following criteria: 
(a) meet the minimum VAF requirement for Myeloid_PBMC for the coverages in Malignant, TAMs and Myeloid_PBMC categories. 
(b) VAF = 0 in the Malignant category. (If the tumor library is enriched for malignant cells, this criteria can be replaced with VAF in Myeloid_PBMC is 20 times more than malignant) 
(c) VAF > 0 in the TAM category. 
(d) VAF > minimum required in Myeloid_PBMC category


The binomial test for detecting the minimum VAF required at a particular coverage was calculated using python as follows:
