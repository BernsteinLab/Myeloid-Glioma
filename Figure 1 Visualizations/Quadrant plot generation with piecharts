######## "matrix_piedot.txt" contains all non-doublet myeloid cells. 
########  Xaxis is calculated by subtracting the usage of Complement Immunosuppression from the usage of IL1B pro-inflammatory ( Usage of IL1B Inflam - Usage of Complement )
########  Yaxis is calculated by subtracting the usage of Scavenger Immunosuppression from the usage of RHOB pro-inflammatory ( Usage of RHOB Inflammatory - Usage of Scavenger )
######## The matrix contains info about the usage of each immunomodulatory program and the percentage of all other remaining programs (including identities as "Others" category summed together)
