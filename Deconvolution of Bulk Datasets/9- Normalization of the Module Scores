To normalize the module scores in each bulk library, the module score of the program is divided by the imputed value of its respective cell type in the CIBERSORTx results outputs.  

(Module score Value /  Imputed CIBERSORTx value for the corresponding category)

(e.g.   Scavenger Module Score / Myeloid Imputed Fraction )


The normalized module scores were then used for correlation with published clinical data available online, including IDH mutation status and, Molecular Grade. 


For correlation with clinical data, the normalized module scores were log10 transformed by using the following formula: 

if x >= 0:  LOG10[Absolute(x) + 1]
if x < 0: - LOG10[Absolute(x) + 1]

Where “x” is the normalized module score value.
